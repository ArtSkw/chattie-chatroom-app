# Chattie - chatroom app

The chat app uses VueJS (v3) for front-end + Firestore Cloud for all back-end logic from Firebase.

Currently the app connects with the initial database stored on Firestore Cloud, although you can switch and configure your own databse in `src/firebase/config.js` - check [Firestore documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) for more details.
